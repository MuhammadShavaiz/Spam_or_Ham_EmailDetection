# Spam Email Detection

This repository contains a basic notebook demonstrating how to predict whether emails are spam or not using Scikit-learn and Pandas. The notebook leverages statistical analysis and model training to classify emails, making it a solid foundation for understanding email classification using machine learning.

## Project Overview

- **Data**: The project uses a publicly available email dataset containing labeled spam and non-spam emails.
- **Libraries**: Scikit-learn, Pandas
- **Key Steps**:
  - Statistical analysis of the dataset.
  - Model training using Scikit-learn's classification models.
  - Evaluation of model performance.
